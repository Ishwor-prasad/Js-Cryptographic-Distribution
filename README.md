Cryptographic Distribution
Cryptographic distribution is essential for securely transmitting cryptographic keys and data. It involves methods like asymmetric cryptography, where public-key techniques are used to exchange symmetric keys securely. Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) plays a crucial role by managing digital keys and certificates, ensuring that public keys are distributed and verified reliably. Key exchange protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman and Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, enable secure key exchanges over insecure channels. Additionally, secure communication channels are established through protocols like SSL/TLS, which encrypt data to protect it during transmission. Cryptographic services,
